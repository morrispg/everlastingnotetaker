The Everlasting NoteTaker

## My Task

My assignment was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

This application presented many challenges. I found myself reverting to how I built HTML pages earlier in the cohort. Learning how to do this in Node shows me some of the power capable of developing this way.
